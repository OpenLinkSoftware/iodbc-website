The following projects are planned to expand the iODBC project into a
complete environment for database connectivity:

## <span id="Implementation%20of%20iodbcinst%20library"></span>Implementation of iodbcinst library

The iodbcinst library has been implemented with graphical support for
GTK on X11/Unix-based systems and Carbon on MacOS X. Support for other
graphical libraries is under consideration.

## <span id="Thread-safety%20%26%20Reentrancy%20Issues"></span>Thread-safety & Reentrancy Issues

iODBC is fully thread-safe and reentrant at present, using POSIX or
native threads.

## <span id="ODBC%203.0%20Specification"></span>ODBC 3.0 Specification

iODBC is compliant with the ODBC specification to version 3.52.

## <span id="ODBC%204.0%20Specification"></span>ODBC 4.0 Specification

OpenLink is currently evaluating the ODBC 4.0 specification draft, and
will add support in a forthcoming release.

Development volunteers are welcomed as this will certainly ensure
acceleration of this roadmap. If OpenLink is left to bear the
development costs then the iODBC community has to accept OpenLink
delivery timeframes. This still remains one of the biggest challenges of
the iODBC project.
