      <h2><a id="What%20is%20ODBC%3F"/>What is ODBC?</h2>
      <p>ODBC is the acronym for Open DataBase Connectivity, a
      Microsoft Universal Data Access standard that started life as
      the Windows implementation of the X/Open SQL Call Level
      Interface specification. Since its inception in 1992 it has
      rapidly become the industry standard interface for developing
      database independent applications. Is is also the emerging
      standard interface for SQL based database engines replacing
      many of the first generation Embedded SQL and proprietary
      call level interfaces provided by database engine and
      database connectivity middleware vendors alike.</p>
      <h2><a id="What%20is%20the%20ODBC%20Value%20Proposition%3F"/>What is
      the ODBC Value Proposition?</h2>
      <p>The ability to develop applications independent of
      back-end database engine.</p>
      <h2><a id="What%20is%20iODBC%3F"/>What is iODBC?</h2>
      <p>iODBC is the acronym for Independent Open DataBase
      Connectivity, an Open Source platform independent
      implementation of both the ODBC and X/Open specifications. It
      is rapidly emerging as the industry standard for developing
      solutions that are language, platform and database
      independent.</p>
      <h2><a id="What%20is%20the%20iODBC%20Value%20Proposition%3F"/>What
      is the iODBC Value Proposition?</h2>The ability to develop
      applications independent of back-end database engine,
      operating system, and for the most part programming language.
      Although ODBC and iODBC are both 'C' based Application
      Programming Interfaces (APIs) there are numerous cross
      language hooks and bridges from languages such as: C++, Java,
      Perl, Python, TCL etc.
      <p>iODBC has been ported to numerous platforms, including
      Linux (x86, Itanium, Alpha, Mips, and StrongArm), Solaris
      (Sparc &amp; x86), AIX, HP-UX (PA-RISC &amp; Itanium),
      Digital UNIX, Dynix, Generic UNIX 5.4, FreeBSD, MacOS 9,
      MacOS X, DG-UX, and OpenVMS.</p>
