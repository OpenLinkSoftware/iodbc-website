      <h2><a id="Getting%20Started"/>Getting Started</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Download relevant source code release</li>
        <li>Build and test on desired platforms</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Note: If in either one of the steps above you stumble
      across any problems/bugs, please contact the OpenLink iODBC
      source archive manager at iodbc@openlinksw.com . Please
      provide as much information regarding the type of platform,
      compiler, compiler flags etc. in your bug report, we will try
      to get back in touch with you rapidly.</p>
      <h2><a id="Bug%20Fixes"/>Bug Fixes</h2>
      <p>If you find a bug and have the know-how to fix it, please
      create a "diff file" using GNU's "diff", possibly with
      "context" (diff -c or diff -u).</p>
      <p>If the patch is small, add the patch file as an attachment
      to your mail if possible, otherwise tell us where we can pick
      it up. This will reduce the turnaround time for new updates
      etc.</p>
      <h2><a id="Suggestions"/>Suggestions</h2>
      <p>Suggestions for new features can be discussed with us,
      through one of the following forums:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Using the Sourceforge.net <a href="https://www.iodbc.org/dataspace/iodbc/wiki/iodbcWiki/MailingLists" class="wikiword">mailing-lists</a>.
        </li>
        <li>Using OpenLink's support phpBB <a href="http://boards.openlinksw.com/support/viewforum.php?f=4" class="absuri">discussion forum</a> for general ODBC
        questions
        </li>
        <li>Direct e-mail to iodbc@openlinksw.com</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Ideas are welcome at all times; ideas accompanied by the
      code that demonstrates core concepts are even more
      welcome.</p>
      <h2><a id="Standards%20Enforcement"/>Standards
      Enforcement</h2>
      <p>This initiative's greatest value is the provision of a
      cross-platform development interface that conforms to both
      the Microsoft ODBC and X/Open SQL CLI data access
      specifications. Thus, ensure that code contributions do not
      compromise this prime objective.</p>
      <p>We will adhere to the official Microsoft ODBC and X/Open
      SQL CLI specs at all times.</p>
      <h2><a id="Project%20Management"/>Project Management</h2>
      <p>If you want to contribute news ideas and functionality,
      please talk to us on either the <a href="https://www.iodbc.org/dataspace/iodbc/wiki/iodbcWiki/MailingLists" class="wikiword">mailing-lists</a> or <a href="http://boards.openlinksw.com/support/viewforum.php?f=4" class="absuri">discussion forum</a> in advance, as this
      reduces the chance of development overlaps.</p>
      <h2><a id="Development%20Standards"/>Development
      Standards</h2>
      <p>All iODBC Driver Manager development needs to be done in
      ANSI C to ensure the best cross platform compatibility. Code
      submissions need to be properly indented (we use the GNU
      'indent' program) and commented in order to make group
      development as productive as possible.</p>
