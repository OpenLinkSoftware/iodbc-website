      <h2><a id="Introduction"/>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The following is a HOWTO document for installing Perl
      modules with the OpenLink iODBC SDK or iODBC Driver Manager
      as an Apache module on Linux/Unix systems. Feel free to
      criticize, suggest modifications, or ask further questions.
      It is currently being maintained by <a href="mailto:iodbc@openlinksw.com">iodbc@openlinksw.com</a>.</p>
      <p>Prerequisite: Basic Unix, Linux or MacOS X familiarity
      (creating directories and users, using an editor, etc).
      Knowledge of how Perl modules work is useful.</p>
      <h2><a id="ODBC%20client%20download%20and%20installation"/>ODBC
      client download and installation</h2>
      <p>This installation will provide the iODBC Driver Manager,
      header files, and example program without source code.
      Additional ODBC driver download is necessary.</p>
      <p>For the latest version, visit the following OpenLink
      Software download pages and choose your download based on
      your client operating system:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>SDK download page</li>
        <li>Multi-Tier ODBC Client download page (choose only
        Client option to download); see footnote 1.</li>
        <li>or Single-Tier driver download page</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The SDK includes the header files required for
      compilation. The second download is only required if you have
      not already installed a third party driver to connect to your
      database. (See also footnote 2.)</p>
      <p>b. Create a new Openlink directory, such as
      /usr/openlink</p>
      <p>c. Copy the "install.sh" file and the ODBC SDK .taz
      archive(s) into <span class="c1"><i>usr</i>
      openlink</span></p>
      <p>d. Navigate to that directory, and run:</p>
      <pre>sh install.sh
</pre>
      <p>This will extract the software, creating lib/ (for the
      driver) and include/ (for the compilation) directories under
      /usr/openlink/odbcsdk</p>
      <p>e. (Optional) Copy your Single-Tier or Multi-Tier ODBC
      Client .taz file and the install.sh into the
      /usr/openlink/odbcsdk directory, navigate to that directory,
      and subsequently run:</p>
      <pre>sh install.sh
</pre>
      <p>f. (Optional) For the Multi-Tier server side download,
      visit the OpenLink Software Multi-Tier download page and
      choose your download based on your server operating
      system.</p>
      <p>g. Unzip the archive and perform an installation (see
      <a href="http://docs.openlinksw.com/mt/" class="absuri">http://docs.openlinksw.com/mt/</a> for more).</p>
      <p>h. Make sure the OpenLink Request Broker (oplrqb) is
      started.</p>
      <h2><a id="iODBC%20Driver%20Manager%20Source%20and%20SDK"/> iODBC
      Driver Manager Source and SDK</h2>
      <p>The iODBC Driver Manager is recommended for programmers or
      those with experience with non-OpenLink drivers. Following
      these steps will perform a generic installation of the driver
      manager onto your system. The files are installed under
      /usr/local, unless you specify otherwise with a different
      --prefix directive at configure-time. It is also recommended
      that you refer to the README and INSTALL files prior to
      proceeding.</p>
      <p>a. From http:/www.iodbc.org/, download the appropriate
      component (for the Driver Manager)</p>
      <p>b. Extract the archive using the following command:</p>
      <pre>gzip -dc &lt; file.taz| tar -xvf -
</pre>
      <p>where file.taz is the file you downloaded.</p>
      <p>c. Move to the source directory which was just created
      from the extraction</p>
      <p>d. Execute the following commands:</p>
      <pre>./configure
make
make check
make install
</pre>
      <h2><a id="Creating%20and%20Testing%20an%20ODBC%20DSN"/>
      Creating and Testing an ODBC DSN</h2>
      <p>You need to create an ODBC DSN (data source). This will
      exist in your client-side odbc.ini file, and can be done in
      one of two ways:</p>
      <h3><a id="Manual%20mode"/>Manual mode</h3>
      <p>You can also review the instructions at the "OpenLink
      iODBC SDK for Unix" link from the Client Components
      Installation section of the Multi-Tier Release 4.0
      documentation. A sample odbc.ini file can be found in the doc
      subdirectory from your OpenLink iODBC SDK installation. To
      begin: a. Set and export the ODBCINI environment variable
      (this assumes you have not moved that file to another
      directory):</p>
      <pre>export ODBCINI=/usr/openlink/odbcsdk/doc/odbc.ini
</pre>
      <p>or</p>
      <pre>setenv ODBCINIT /usr/openlink/odbcsdk/doc/odbc.ini
</pre>
      <p>depending on your shell.</p>
      <h4><a id="Create%20your%20DSN"/>Create your DSN</h4>
      <p>For example, to connect to an MS Access database on
      Windows, you can create a [dsn_access] section, change the
      Host, ServerType, Database, Username and Password entries to
      match your server settings. Here is part of the odbc.ini
      file:</p>
      <pre>[dsn_access]
Driver = /usr/openlink/odbcsdk/lib/oplodbc.so.1
Host =
ServerType = Odbc
Database =
UserName = sa
Password =
;FetchBufferSize = 30
</pre>
      <p>where Host is the machine hosting your MS Access database,
      and Database the is the name of the MS Access driver DSN you
      set up in the Windows ODBC control panel.</p>
      <h4><a id="Run%20%22iodbctest%22"/> Run "iodbctest"</h4>
      <pre>cd /usr/openlink/odbcsdk/examples
./iodbctest
</pre>
      <p>d. At the prompt, type a valid connect string, such as
      `DSN=dsn_access' (from above example)</p>
      <p>e. Once you get a prompt, you are connected and can
      execute any valid SQL against your database, or `<span class="c1">tables</span>' to obtain a list of tables in that
      database.</p>
      <h3><a id="Graphical%20mode"/>Graphical mode</h3>
      <p>You can configure data sources by using the Admin
      Assistant HTML wizards (accessible once the Request Broker is
      started on the client). (See footnote 3.)</p>
      <p>1. Ensure that your openlink.sh file has been sourced in
      the current shell.</p>
      <p>2. Start the Request Broker:</p>
      <pre>cd /usr/openlink/bin
./oplrqb
</pre>
      <p>c. Navigate to <a href="http://localhost:8000/" class="absuri">http://localhost:8000/</a> on the client
      machine.</p>
      <p>d. In "Client Components Administration", proceed to
      configure an ODBC Data Source and test.</p>
      <h2><a id=""/> FreeBSD-specific Concerns</h2>
      <p>On FreeBSD, it has been found to help if perl is compiled
      with threading; to do this, you need to build it from the
      lang/perl58/ port, and define WITH_THREADS (e.g. in
      /etc/make.conf).</p>
      <h2><a id=""/> MacOS X-specific Concerns</h2>
      <p>On MacOS X, you have the option to compile libraries
      either as traditional unix-like shared libraries, or as a
      `framework'. On OS X, the latter is generally preferred - for
      example, iODBC is built as a framework, most of the Perl
      modules are, etc.</p>
      <p>The instructions below for DBI apply regardless; however,
      for DBD::ODBC you have a choice of one or other method.</p>
      <h2><a id="Compiling%20the%20Perl%20Modules%20for%20ODBC%20support"/>
      Compiling the Perl Modules for ODBC support</h2>
      <p>Perl's DBI is a generic database interface module for
      Perl; DBD is a range of specific database interfaces,
      DBD::Pg, DBD::Sybase, DBD::Oracle, DBD::ODBC, etc, loaded by
      DBI.</p>
      <h3><a id="DBI"/> DBI</h3>
      <p>Download the DBI module from CPAN - this is frequently
      provided as a package with your operating system;
      alternatively, you can download it from CPAN
      (http:/search.cpan.org) under the "Database Interfaces"
      category.</p>
      <p>Assuming you have a working Perl installation already
      installed on your system, we recommend the following method -
      using Perl's CPAN module - to automate the whole process:</p>
      <pre>bash# perl -MCPAN -e shell
cpan&gt;

</pre>
      <p>More documentation on this method is to be found at
      http:/www.perldoc.com/perl5.6/pod/perlmodinstall.html .</p>
      <h3><a id="DBD::ODBC"/> DBD::ODBC</h3>
      <p>Download the DBD::ODBC module from CPAN. You can either
      download it by hand from
      http:/www.perl.com/CPAN-local/modules/index.html, or use the
      following to obtain it - note that we only recommend getting
      it this way rather than attempting a full install, as some
      intervention is necessary to configure and compile it:</p>
      <pre>bash# perl -MCPAN -e shell
cpan&gt;

Configuring DBD::ODBC ...

&gt;&gt;&gt;Remember to actually *READ* the README file!
And re-read it if you have any problems.

Using DBI 1.30 installed in /usr/lib/perl5/auto/DBI
Using ODBC in /opt/openlink/odbcsdk

Umm, this looks like a iodbc type of driver manager.

We expect to find the isql.h, isqlext.h and iodbc.h files (which were
supplied with iODBC) in $ODBCHOME/include directory alongside the
/opt/openlink/odbcsdk/lib/libiodbc.a /opt/openlink/odbcsdk/lib/libiodbc.so
library.

Using DBI 1.30 installed in /usr/lib/perl5/auto/DBI
Writing Makefile for DBD::ODBC
</pre>
      <p>This tells this particular compilation of DBD::ODBC to use
      the iODBC installation in the openlink odbcsdk distribution.
      To perform the actual build, simply type `make'.</p>
      <p>Note: There is a bug in some versions of DBD::ODBC's
      Makefile.PL whereby the generated Makefile is invalid -
      typically you get an error such as</p>
      <pre>Makefile:313: *** missing separator.  Stop.
</pre>
      <p>You can simply comment-out the offending line, thus:</p>
      <pre>config :: $(changes_pm)
#    @$(NOOP)
</pre>
      <p>Alternatively, replacing the leading spaces with a TAB
      character will also fix it.</p>
      <h4><a id=""/> MacOSX-specific note</h4>
      <p>Instead of typing `make' above, if you wish to build this
      module as a framework instead of a shared library, you will
      have to edit the generated Makefile; you still use the same
      `perl Makefile.PL -o /path/to/iodbc' command to generate the
      Makefile (it will fail if it can't find the lib/ directory,
      and fail to compile if it can't find the headers to include),
      but the references to `-liodbc' should become `-framework
      iODBC' throughout, and the `-L'(path to iodbc/lib) should be
      removed, thus:</p>
      <pre>VERSION_FROM = ODBC.pm
INC = -I. -I/Library/Perl/darwin/auto/DBI
DEFINE = -I/Users/openlink/tim/iodbc-shared/include
OBJECT = $(O_FILES)
</pre>
      <pre># DBD::ODBC might depend on some other libraries:
# See ExtUtils::Liblist for details
#
EXTRALIBS = -framework iODBC
LDLOADLIBS = -framework iODBC
BSLOADLIBS =
LD_RUN_PATH = # /Users/openlink/tim/iodbc-shared/lib
</pre>
      <h4><a id="Testing%20DBD%3A%3AODBC"/>Testing
      DBD::ODBC</h4>
      <p>You should also run through the tests - assign values to
      these variables:</p>
      <pre>The DBD::ODBC tests will use these values for the database connection:
DBI_DSN=e.g. dbi:ODBC:demo
DBI_USER=
DBI_PASS=
</pre>
      <p>and execute `make test'. Optionally, for maximum
      verbosity, use</p>
      <pre>make test TEST_VERBOSE=1
</pre>
      <p>instead.</p>
      <h4><a id="Installation"/>Installation</h4>
      <p>Finally, become root if you were not already, using su or
      sudo or equivalent, and type</p>
      <pre>make install
</pre>
      <p>to install DBD::ODBC into your perl tree. A short sample
      perl script using DBD::ODBC might be the following:</p>
      <pre>bash# cat &gt; dbitest.pl
#!/usr/bin/perl

use DBI;
use DBD::ODBC;

$|=1;

map {
print "Data sources for $_: " . join("
", DBI-&gt;data_sources($_)). "
"
}
grep(!/ADO|template/, DBI-&gt;available_drivers);
</pre>
      <p>which, when you run it, lists all data-sources for all the
      installed DBD:: drivers, now including ODBC:</p>
      <pre>bash# perl ./dbitest.pl
Data sources for CSV:
DBI:CSV:f_dir=mytest
DBI:CSV:f_dir=t
DBI:CSV:f_dir=blib
Data sources for ODBC:
DBI:ODBC:DB2v7.x(linux)
DBI:ODBC:DB2v7.x(aix32bit)
DBI:ODBC:DB2v7.x(solaris)

        <li>OpenLink Multi-tier drivers involve installation on
        both the client- and server-sides.<br/>
        <br/></li>
        <li>A known bug was discovered when using certain versions
        of the OpenLink iODBC SDK coupled with Perl DBD, whereby a
        disconnect in the Perl script would cause a core dump. The
        bug did not prove to affect script functionality; it was
        driver-specific. The problem has been addressed in the
        latest ODBC SDK available at OpenLink Software's web site
        (see the iODBC SDK option). For this reason, unless you are
        using non-OpenLink drivers to connect in your scripts, it
        is recommended that you install the OpenLink iODBC SDK
        option for your ODBC home.<br/>
        <br/></li>
        <li>If you configure a DSN using the Admin Assistant,
        you'll have to copy the modified odbc.ini file into either
        the home directory (or " ~/.") of the Perl account, or
        export ODBCINI to point at it, for it to be recognized at
        run-time.<br/>

      <h2><a id="Glossary"/> Glossary</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Admin Assistant</b> - the Admin Assistant is an
        HTML-based interface which simplifies the process of
        configuring text-based configuration files used in the
        OpenLink Multi-Tier data architecture. It is made available
        via the OpenLink Request Broker, which is available for
        download for your Unix/ Linux client from the OpenLink
        Multi-Tier download page. Since the Request Broker is a
        server component, you obtain it by specifying your server
        platform as your Unix/ Linux client. Once downloaded, you
        can install the archive into your ODBC home directory. It
        will be installed as the file "oplrqb" in a bin
        subdirectory. More information can be found at the link
        "ODBC Client Components for Unix" (Wizards-Based Data
        Source Management) in the OpenLink Multi-Tier Release 4.0
        documentation.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Database Agent</b> - an OpenLink Database Agent is
        an executable process which initiates a connection to the
        specified database (in the ServerType odbc.ini parameter).
        For ServerTypes of "Odbc", it acts as a generic agent,
        acting as a proxy to the actual database driver which will
        complete the connection on the server.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><b>ODBC home directory</b> - this is the directory to
        which you have installed either the iODBC driver manager or
        the OpenLink iODBC SDK. It will contain directories like
        include and lib directly under it.</li>

        <li><b>Request Broker</b> - the OpenLink Request Broker is
        a server daemon which listens on a specified TCP port
        (default of 5000) and broadcasts on a UDP port. It acts
        exactly as its name suggests, "brokering" out incoming
        connection requests to the appropriate Database Agent
        process. The Request Broker implicitly starts another
        server daemon called "www_sv" which acts as a stand-alone
        web server providing easy configuration for initialization
        files.</li>
