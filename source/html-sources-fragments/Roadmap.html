      <p>The following projects are planned to expand the iODBC
      project into a complete environment for database
      connectivity:</p>
      <h2><a id="Implementation%20of%20iodbcinst%20library"/>Implementation
      of iodbcinst library</h2>
      <p>The iodbcinst library has been implemented with graphical
      support for GTK on X11/Unix-based systems and Carbon on MacOS
      X. Support for other graphical libraries is under
      consideration.</p>
      <h2><a id="Thread-safety%20%26%20Reentrancy%20Issues"/>Thread-safety
      &amp; Reentrancy Issues</h2>
      <p>iODBC is fully thread-safe and reentrant at present, using
      POSIX or native threads.</p>
      <h2><a id="ODBC%203.0%20Specification"/>ODBC 3.0
      Specification</h2>
      <p>iODBC is compliant with the ODBC specification to version
      3.52.</p>
      <h2><a id="ODBC%204.0%20Specification"/>ODBC 4.0
      Specification</h2>
      <p>OpenLink is currently evaluating the ODBC 4.0
      specification draft, and will add support in a forthcoming
      release.</p>
      <p>Development volunteers are welcomed as this will certainly
      ensure acceleration of this roadmap. If OpenLink is left to
      bear the development costs then the iODBC community has to
      accept OpenLink delivery timeframes. This still remains one
      of the biggest challenges of the iODBC project.</p>
